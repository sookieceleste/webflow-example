The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website (including your truncated IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google&#x27;s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. By using the Website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.For more information about Google Analytics, including Google’s privacy policy, please visit <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html">http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html</a> If you would like to stop your data being sent to Google for analytics purposes, you can install the Google Analytics Browser Add-On, details of which are available at <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.Given the general discussion regarding the use of analysis tools with complete IP-addresses, we would like to inform you that this website is using Google Analytics with the extension &quot;_anonymizeIp()&quot; which means that IP-addresses are only processed in a shortened manner to prevent any direct personal references.<br><br>‍<br></p>
                      <p class="cookies"><strong>What are cookies?<br>‍<br></strong>A cookie is a small text file that a website saves onyour computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don&#x27;t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.<strong><br>‍<br>How do we use cookies?<br>‍<br></strong>- your display preferences, such as contrast colour settings or font size- if you have already replied to a survey pop-up that asks you if the content was helpful or not (so you won&#x27;t be asked again)- if you have agreed (or not) to our use of cookies on this siteAlso, some videos embedded in our pages use a cookie to anonymously gather statistics on how you got there and what videos you visited. Enabling these cookies is not strictly necessary for the website to work but it will provide you with a better browsing experience. You can delete or block these cookies, but if you do that some features of this site may not work as intended. The cookie-related information is not used to identify you personally and the pattern data is fully under our control. These cookies are not used for any purpose other than those described here.<strong><br><br>Preferences<br>‍<br></strong>These cookies allow our websites to remember information that changes the way the site behaves or looks, such as your preferred language or the region you are in. For instance, by remembering your region, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news. These cookies can also assist you in changing text size, font and other parts of web pages that you can personalize.Loss of the information stored in a preference cookie may make the website experience less functional but should not prevent it from working.Most Google users will have a preferences cookie called ‘PREF’ in their browsers. A browser sends this cookie with requests to Google’s sites. The PREF cookie may store your preferences and other information, in particular your preferred language (e.g. English), how many search results you wish to have shown per page (e.g. 10 or 20), and whether or not you wish to have Google’s SafeSearch filter turned on.<strong><br><br>Security<br><br></strong>We use security cookies to authenticate users, prevent fraudulent use of login credentials, and protect user data from unauthorized parties. For example, we use cookies called ‘SID’ and ‘HSID’ which contain digitally signed and encrypted records of a user’s Google account ID and most recent sign-in time. The combination of these two cookies allows us to block many types of attack, such as attempts to steal the content of forms that you complete on web pages.<strong><br><br>Processes<br><br></strong>Process cookies help make the website work and deliver services that the website visitor expects, like navigating around web pages or accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies, the website cannot function properly.For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ which makes it possible for Google Docs to open many Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from operating correctly.<strong><br><br>Advertising<br><br></strong>We use cookies to make advertising more engaging to users and more valuable to publishers and advertisers. Some common applications of cookies are to select advertising based on what’s relevant to a user; to improve reporting on campaign performance; and to avoid showing ads the user has already seen.Google uses cookies, like the PREF, NID, and SID cookies, to help customize ads on Google properties, like Google Search. For example, we use such cookies to remember your most recent searches, your previous interactions with an advertiser’s ads or search results, and your visits to an advertiser’s website. This helps us to show you customized ads on Google.We also use cookies for advertising we serve across the web. Our main advertising cookie on non-Google sites is called ‘id’ and it is stored in browsers under the domain <a href="http://doubleclick.net">doubleclick.net</a>. We use others with names such as <em>drt</em>, FLC, and exchange_uid.Sometimes a cookie may be set on the domain of the site you are visiting. In the case of our DoubleClick product, a cookie called ‘__gads’ may be set on the domain of the site you are visiting.Other Google properties, like YouTube, may also use DoubleClick cookies to show you more relevant ads. Find out more about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/interest_based_ads">ads and YouTube.</a>Google also uses conversion cookies whose main purpose is to help advertisers determine how many times people who click on their ads end up purchasing their products. These cookies allow Google and the advertiser to determine that you clicked the ad and later visited the advertiser site. Conversion cookies are not used by Google for interest-based ad targeting and persist for a limited time only. These cookies are generally set in the <a href="http://googleadservices.com">googleadservices.com</a> or <a href="http://google.com/ads">google.com/ads</a> domain. Conversion cookie data may also be used in combination with your Google account to link conversion events across different devices you use. Only anonymous conversion data gathered from these cookies is shared with advertisers.Some of our other cookies may be used to measure conversion events as well. For example, DoubleClick and Google Analytics cookies may also be used for this purpose and may be set in the domain of the site you are visiting.<strong><br><br>Session State<br><br></strong>Websites often collect information about how users interact with a website. This may include the pages users visit most often, and whether users get error messages from certain pages. We use these so-called ‘session state cookies’ to help us improve our services, in order to improve our users’ browsing experience. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not render the website unusable.These cookies may also be used to anonymously measure the effectiveness of PPC (pay per click) and affiliate advertising.For example, we use a cookie called ‘recently_watched_video_id_list’ so that YouTube can record the videos most recently watched by a particular browser.<strong><br><br>Analytics<br><br></strong>Google Analytics is Google’s analytics tool that helps website and app owners to understand how their visitors engage with their properties. It may use a set of cookies to collect information and report website usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors to Google.In addition to reporting website usage statistics, the Google Analytics pixel tag can also be used, together with some of the advertising cookies described above, to help show more relevant ads on Google properties (like Google Search) and across the web.Learn more about <a href="http://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies">Analytics cookies and privacy information</a>.<strong><br><br>Manage your preferences:<br>‍<br></strong>Most web browsers allow you to manage your cookie preferences. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, or delete certain cookies. Generally you should also be able manage similar technologies in the same way that you manage cookies – using your browsers preferences.
